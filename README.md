# Testing 
- Tested the webpage on these browsers: Brave Browser, Chrome, Firefox and Safari. 
- I confirmed that the game results are always correct.
- I confirmed that header, instructions, item selection and results are readable and easy to understand. 
- I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and acessible by running the lighthouse: 

**To save some time and easy to conduct the lighthouse I was only able to come up with lighthouse figures in Swedish, therefore you'll have the English Translation here:**

**Prestanda: Performance**
**Tillgänglighet: Accessibility**
**Bästa Metoder: Best Practices**
